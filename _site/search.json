We have reserved a section of the garden for wedding guests to camp, which has 4 preexisting deluxe tents. If you have camping gear (tent, pad, quilt / blanket), please bring it. Otherwise, let us know when RSVPing, and we’ll place you in one of the deluxe tents (which includes cots and blankets). We will also be setting up extra tents from our surplus gear.\nEach deluxe tent has six cots. Therefore, ideally we can find parties of 4-6 to sleep in them. If your party size is 4-6 or you have other individuals you’d like to stay with, let us know. Families might be a good fit.\nFor guests that aren’t staying on the premises, we will try to suggest some local hotels, but we will not be heavily involved in this area of the planning.\nCamping map at https://greatriveroutfitters.com/images/files/Camping_Rules_Regulations.pdf\n\n\n\n",
