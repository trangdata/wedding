## Can I bring a +1?

Yes, if we are aware of a likely +1,
we probably named them in your invite or sent them a separate invite.
If we didn't, you can still list them as part of your party in the RSVP form.

## Are children allowed?

Yes!
Bring your babies, and we'll teach them Ultimate.

## Are pets allowed?

Unfortunately, the venue doesn't allow pets.
We're sorry but you'll have to leave your furry friends at home.

## Where do I shower?

There are two solar-bag setups for showering.
The Connecticut River is also quite clean and refreshing at this latitude.
Please note that the facilities are minimal in general.
