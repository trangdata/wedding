## Race Results

On Sunday, many elite and recreational runners braved the rain and fatigue to run the Off-the-Grid 5k Race.
Course details are available in [the FAQ](/faq.html#running-course).
We are grateful to former Hanover High Cross Country coach, Jim Eakin, for proper timing and setting of the finish line.
Here are the results:
