The event will be at the [**Path of Life Sculpture Garden**](https://greatriveroutfitters.com/news-and-events/welcome-to-the-path-of-life-sculpture-garden),
which is operated by [Great River Outfitters](https://greatriveroutfitters.com).

The venue is located in [Artisan's Park](https://www.artisanspark.net/), a "collection of 8 unique Vermont businesses."
Once at Artisan's Park, you enter the garden through the Great River Outfitters shop,

The garden is enclosed on one side by the railroad and the other by the mighty Connecticut River.
