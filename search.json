Tàu\n\n\n\nvào lúc 18 giờ 30 phút\n\nThứ Hai, ngày 26 tháng 12 năm 2022\nMonday, December 26, 2022\n(nhằm ngày 04 tháng 12 năm Nhâm Dần)\n\n\nSự hiện diện của quý khách là niềm vinh hạnh cho gia đình chúng tôi.\nTrân trọng kính mời!\n\nFor alien visitors\nWelcome!\nWe’re thrilled that you’re coming to visit Trang’s beautiful hometown!\nWe’re working on a Viet Nam must-read Notion page.\nWe include some crucial information below, but please check out the Notion page for more detail.\nAnd, of course, let us know if you have any additional questions.\nEvents\nYou’re invited to two official events on Monday, December 26,\nboth in the peninsular city of Vũng Tàu where one can watch both sunrise and sunset over the ocean.\nFirst is the morning engagement ceremony called Đám Hỏi,\nwhere the groom’s family & friends present dowric offerings to the bride’s family\n(at their residence).\nSecond is the evening wedding reception at the Palace Hotel.\n\nLodging\nIf you would like to stay at the 4-star Palace Hotel,\nyou can book via Priceline, Booking.com, Expedia, etc.\nThe nightly rate is around $50 including breakfast.\nThere are a few AirBnB options but they can be a little further away from city center.\n\nThe hotel finds it too logistically challenging to offer any group discount.\nTravel\nWe will be in Viet Nam from Nov 27 to Dec 28, 2022.\nLet us know when you arrive so Trang can be your guide for a few days!\nVung Tau\nThe closest airport to Vung Tau is SGN (Saigon / Ho Chi Minh City).\nTo get to Vung Tau, there are shuttles from the airport every 20 mins or so, unless you arrive at a strange time.\nYou should see a shuttle lane when you get outside.\nMake sure to tell them you’re going to Vung Tau.\nCost is ~$10/person and the shuttle will take you to your exact address.\nDepending on traffic, travel time is 2—2.5 hours.\nSome popular shuttle companies are: Hoa Mai, Thanh Vinh, Toan Thang, Huy Hoang, and Anh Quoc.\nHoi An\nHội An is a site of world heritage in central Vietnam.\nWe have booked group lodging in a 7 bedroom villa overlooking the rice paddies for anyone who’d like to join.\nThe villa is reserved from December 16–22 (Friday–Thursday).\nThe villa is in the Cẩm Thanh village and is referred to as “The An Retreat Hoi An by Đặng Viết Đồng”.\nDetails can be found on facebook and airbnb.\nWe’ll try to acquire world-class amenities:\nan occasional private chef and bicycles for all.\nThe GPS location is 15.88536, 108.35432\n(see on Google or OpenStreetMap),\nwhich is roughly this address:\n\nTống Văn Sương, Hamlet 5\nHội An, Quảng Nam 560000, Vietnam\n\nTo get to Hội An, fly to Đà Nẵng Airport (DAD).\nThis will be a cheap domestic flight and is probably easiest to book separately from your flight to Vietnam.\nViệt Nam visa\nForeign visitors will need a visa.\nIf your stay does not exceed 30 days and includes only a single entry into Vietnam,\nyou can get an e-visa here.\nThe e-visa process is entirely online, takes ~3 days to process, and costs $25.\nWe recommend paying with a credit card with no foreign transaction fee.\nFor other types of visas, see the USA Embassy site for more information.\nWe will provide you with the contact details for Trang’s father,\nshould the visa requires a sponsor or destination address.\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions!\nReading:\nVietnam International Travel Information (state.gov)\nvietnamembassy-usa.org\nMonie\n1 USD ~= 23,000 VND\nThe best way to get Viet Nam Dong (VND) is from an ATM, so bring a debit card!\nWe’re not sure how much the Exchange Booths in Viet Nam overcharge you, but we generally avoid them at other airports!\nThere are 2 ATMs in the arrivals hall at SGN airport: a BIDV and a citibank, facing each other.\nIf you’re taking a taxi from the airport, you can also ask them to stop at an ATM on the way to your destination.\nThe ATM fee is usually ~3% of the amount you withdraw.\nWe also recommend bringing some USD cash with you from the US.\nYou can always go to any bank in Viet Nam to exchange to VND\n(no fee, unlike the Exchange Booth).\n\n\nThere is no limit but if you’re bringing more than $5,000, be sure to declare at customs.\nReading:\nATMs in Ho Chi Minh City | i Tour Vietnam Blogs (itourvn.com)\nHow NOT to get scammed at Saigon Airport
