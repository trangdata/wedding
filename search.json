We’re sorry but you’ll have to leave your furry friends at home.\nAre children allowed?\nYes! Bring your babies, and we’ll teach them Ultimate.\nDress\nThere is no dress code. But you can help us commemmorate the occasion by wearing creative and colorful attire for the Saturday ceremony and reception. Dress wild! The more extravagant and ugly the better.\nOh behave!The event will be on grass. Do not wear stiletto heels. Prefer high-performing footwear or bring a change of shoes, such that your celebrate to your fullest ability. See Camping for helpful attire for the whole weekend.\nRunning Course\nThe Off the Grid 5k will be Sunday at 9 AM. The race starts and ends at the stone flower. It goes around the Path of Life Garden and adjacent farm in a clockwise direction. Run two laps.\nStarting at the Stone Flower, run clockwise on the perimeter gravel road that goes around the deluxe tents. Continue past the reception tent. Do not cross the railroad tracks. Never during the race will you cross the railroad.\nNext you’ll turn onto a path in the woods and cross a stream that divides the Path of Life Garden and the neighboring farm. Take a left out of the woods to continue around the perimeter of the farm, going around the solar farm.\nContinue around the entire farm, staying to the left, except not crossing the railroad. When exiting the garm, The path onto the lower bridge to return from to Path of Life garden is narrow. The bridge is slanted and slippery. Use caution.\nContinue along the grass road in the Path of Life garden. If it’s your second lap, stop at the finish line.\nOff the Grid 5K running course superimposed on aerial imageryFinal notes\nWe can’t wait to see you in just a couple days at the Loveroo Club wedding. It has been an exciting time in the Upper Valley region, with a major storm causing erosion and downed trees. The dam upstream of the Path of Life Garden hit outflows of 19,000 cubic feet per second, compared to a historical median of 3,000 on this day. The moon is poised to go full buck on Friday night to ring in the festivities. And Amtrak resumed passenger service on its historic Vermonter line, so attendees can expect twice daily train sightings.\nThe ceremony starts at 4:00 pm Saturday sharp. Please arrive by 3:30 pm.\nThe river trip on Friday departs at 2:00 pm. Arrive by 1:30 pm.\nThe weather looks great with highs of 80°F and lows of 55°F, with a slight chance of rain. Nighttime temperatures can be a bit chilly, so bring an outer layer and insulation for sleeping.\nIf you’re arriving early Friday for the river trip and need to refrigerate something for the potluck, Artisan Eats is lending us some refrigerator space. When you enter the Path of Life Garden via Great River Outfitters, ask for the Artisan Eats fridge, which is in the same building.\nWe also have coolers at the event tent, and near the deluxe tents. Best to bring any booze to these coolers rather than Artisans Eat.\nWe’ll probably have a propane grill going at some points over the weekend at one of the deluxe tents.\nIf you’re coming by way of the Dartmouth Coach or Amtrak and need a ride, let us know. We’ll try to recruit some volunteers to pick you up. In this neck of the woods, hitchhiking is more reliable than Uber or Lyft.\nLet us know if you’d like to give a short speech at the reception.\nWhere do I shower?\nThere are two shower stalls, which operate using solar bags provided by the Outfitters. There is also a cold water shower at the shop. The Connecticut River is also quite clean and refreshing at this latitude. Please note that the facilities are minimal in general.\nHow can I help?\nWe’d love your help in making our wedding special. Here are some examples of ways you could assist, inspired by actual invitees!\nCan lend my strength for setup\nCan help clean up\nI’m a licensed airman and can take a drone video\nCan play cello\nCan bring a lawn game called King Kubb\nHave AV skills\nHave a 10kW generator you could borrow (Let us know if you have this!)\nCan make wildflower bouquets\nCan do Trang’s hair\nCan be in charge of coffee\nIf you’d like to offer a skill or lend an item, let us know in your RSVP or by email. See also the volunteer spreadsheet, where you can add yourself with “Suggest Changes” mode.\nCan I bring a +1?\nIf we were aware of a likely +1, we probably named them in your invite or sent them a separate invite. If we didn’t, you can still list them as part of your party in the RSVP form or ask us separately. And we will confirm that the additional guest doesn’t exceed capacity restrictions.\nWho helped build the website?\nHuge thanks to our dear friend, Silvia Canelón, for creating this beautiful website. And Trang’s sister Ngọc for creating the invitation video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho can make it?\n\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\n  will_attend          n\n  <chr>            <dbl>\n1 Can't make it 😭    26\n2 Yes!!!             109\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\n  will_camp n_camps\n  <chr>       <dbl>\n1 Maybe          13\n2 No             38\n3 Yes            58\n\nWho’s doing what?\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 2\n  activity                    participation\n  <fct>                               <dbl>\n1 Friday River Trip                      55\n2 Friday Potluck Dinner                  83\n3 Saturday Lunch                         92\n4 Saturday Ceremony                     109\n5 Saturday Dinner & Reception           109\n6 Sunday Off-the-grid 5K Run             66\n\nWhat did you write us?\n\n\n\nWho’s responsible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
