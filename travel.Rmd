- [Manchester-Boston Regional Airport](https://www.flymanchester.com/) (MHT).

  Serviced by Cape Air with [flights from](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-lebanon-leb) BOS (Jet Blue codeshare) and White Plains (HPN).
  There is little convenience to these flights over ground transportation,
  but the small planes do make for a memorable experience.
