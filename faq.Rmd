## Are pets allowed?

Unfortunately, the venue doesn't allow pets.
We're sorry but you'll have to leave your furry friends at home.

## Are children allowed?

Yes!
Bring your babies, and we'll teach them Ultimate.

## Dress

There is no dress code.
But you can help us commemmorate the occasion by wearing creative and colorful attire for the Saturday ceremony and reception.
Dress wild! The more extravagant and ugly the better.

The event will be on grass.
**Do not wear stiletto heels.**

## Running Course

The Off the Grid 5k will be Sunday at 9 AM. The race starts and ends at the stone flower.
It goes around the Path of Life Garden and adjacent farm in a clockwise direction.
Run two laps.

Starting at the Stone Flower,
run clockwise on the perimeter gravel road that goes around the deluxe tents.
Continue past the reception tent. Do not cross the railroad tracks.
Never during the race will you cross the railroad.

Next you’ll turn onto a path in the woods and cross a stream that divides the Path of Life Garden and the neighboring farm.
Take a left out of the woods to continue around the perimeter of the farm, going around the solar farm.

Continue around the entire farm, staying to the left, except not crossing the railroad.
When exiting the garm, The path onto the lower bridge to return from to Path of Life garden is narrow.
The bridge is slanted and slippery. Use caution.

Continue along the grass road in the Path of Life garden.
If it’s your second lap, stop at the finish line.

The red line is the route for the run (two loops for a 5K). The purple circles show the parking for overnight guests (top) and main event location (bottom).

## Final notes

We can’t wait to see you in just a couple days at the Loveroo Club wedding.
It has been an exciting time in the Upper Valley region, with a major storm causing erosion and downed trees.
The dam upstream of the Path of Life Garden [hit](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=01144500) outflows of 19,000 cubic feet per second, compared to a historical median of 3,000 on this day.
The moon is poised to go full buck on Friday night to ring in the festivities.
And Amtrak resumed passenger service on its historic Vermonter line, so attendees can expect twice daily train sightings.

- The ceremony starts at 4:00 pm Saturday sharp.
  Please arrive by 3:30 pm.
- The river trip on Friday departs at 2:00 pm.
  Arrive by 1:30 pm.
- The weather looks great with highs of 80°F and lows of 55°F, with a slight chance of rain.
  Nighttime temperatures can be a bit chilly, so bring an outer layer and insulation for sleeping.
- If you're arriving early Friday for the river trip and need to refrigerate something for the potluck,
  Artisan Eats is lending us some refrigerator space. When you enter the Path of Life Garden via Great River Outfitters,
  ask for the Artisan Eats fridge, which is in the same building.
- We also have coolers at the event tent, and near the deluxe tents.
  Best to bring any booze to these coolers rather than Artisans Eat.
- We'll probably have a propane grill going at some points over the weekend at one of the deluxe tents.
- If you're coming by way of the Dartmouth Coach or Amtrak and need a ride, let us know.
  We'll try to recruit some volunteers to pick you up. In this neck of the woods, hitchhiking is more reliable than Uber or Lyft.
- Let us know if you'd like to give a short speech at the reception.

## Where do I shower?

There are two shower stalls, which operate using solar bags provided by the Outfitters.
There is also a cold water shower at the shop.
The Connecticut River is also quite clean and refreshing at this latitude.
Please note that the facilities are minimal in general.

## How can I help?

We'd love your help in making our wedding special.
Here are some examples of ways you could assist, inspired by actual invitees!

- Can lend my strength for setup
- Can help clean up
- I'm a licensed airman and can take a drone video
- Can play cello
- Can bring a lawn game called King Kubb
- Have AV skills
- Have a 10kW generator you could borrow (Let us know if you have this!)
- Can make wildflower bouquets
- Can do Trang's hair
- Can be in charge of coffee

If you'd like to offer a skill or lend an item, let us know in your RSVP or by email.
See also the [volunteer spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BMRferPCqIV4O8njqfRbv_G5mWCsBcuCn4SATA08Zqs/edit#gid=512827234), where you can add yourself with "Suggest Changes" mode.

## Can I bring a +1?

If we were aware of a likely +1,
we probably named them in your invite or sent them a separate invite.
If we didn't, you can still list them as part of your party in the RSVP form or ask us separately.
And we will confirm that the additional guest doesn't exceed capacity restrictions.

## Who helped build the website?

Huge thanks to our dear friend, [Silvia Canelón](https://silvia.rbind.io), for creating this beautiful website.
And Trang's sister Ngọc for creating the invitation video.
