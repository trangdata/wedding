### Hello and welcome! 
`⅀(x, y) = "$x ♥️ $y"`

We are celebrating our marriage **July 23--25, 2021** at an encampment along the Connecticut River in Windsor, Vermont.
The venue is the [Path of Life Garden](https://greatriveroutfitters.com/news-and-events/welcome-to-the-path-of-life-sculpture-garden), which is a fusion of stunning sculpture arts, event space, river trip outfiters, and campground.

The ceremony and reception will start at _4 pm_ on **Saturday, July 24**.
We hope you can join us camping and a whole weekend of fun (see [Schedule](schedule.html) and [Venue](venue.html)).
