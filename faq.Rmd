## Are pets allowed?

Unfortunately, the venue doesn't allow pets.
We're sorry but you'll have to leave your furry friends at home.

## Are kids allowed?
Yes!
Bring your babies and we'll teach them Ultimate.

## Where do I shower?
There is a solar-bag setup for showering.
We also recommend bathing in the river.
Please note that the facility is minimal in general.
