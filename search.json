If we didn’t, you can still list them as part of your party in the RSVP form or ask us separately. And we will confirm that the additional guest doesn’t exceed capacity restrictions.\nAre children allowed?\nYes! Bring your babies, and we’ll teach them Ultimate.\nAre pets allowed?\nUnfortunately, the venue doesn’t allow pets. We’re sorry but you’ll have to leave your furry friends at home.\nDress\nThere is no dress code. But you can help us commemmorate the occasion by wearing creative and colorful attire for the Saturday ceremony and reception. Dress wild! The more extravagant and ugly the better.\nThe event will be on grass. Do not wear stiletto heels. Prefer high-performing footwear or bring a change of shoes, such that your celebrate to your fullest ability. See Camping for helpful attire for the whole weekend.\nWhere do I shower?\nThere are two shower stalls, which operate using solar bags provided by the Outfitters. There is also a cold water shower at the shop. The Connecticut River is also quite clean and refreshing at this latitude. Please note that the facilities are minimal in general.\nHow can I help?\nWe’d love your help in making our wedding special. Here are some examples of ways you could assist, inspired by actual invitees!\nCan lend my strength for setup\nI’m a licensed airman and can take a drone video\nCan play cello\nCan bring a lawn game called King Kubb\nHave AV skills\nHave a 10kW generator you could borrow (Let us know if you have this!)\nCan make wildflower bouquets\nIf you’d like to offer a skill or lend an item, let us know in your RSVP or by email.\nWho helped build the website?\nHuge thanks to our dear friend, Silvia Canelón, for creating this beautiful website.
