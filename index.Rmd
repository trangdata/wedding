### Xin chào!

`⅀(x, y) = "$x ♥️ $y"`

We are celebrating our marriage **July 23--25, 2021** at an encampment along the Connecticut River in Windsor, Vermont.
The venue is the [Path of Life Garden](https://greatriveroutfitters.com/news-and-events/welcome-to-the-path-of-life-sculpture-garden),
which is a fusion of stunning sculpture arts, event space, river trip outfiters, and campground.

The ceremony and reception will start at _4 pm_ on **Saturday, July 24**.
We hope you can join us camping and a whole weekend of fun (see [Schedule](/schedule) and [Venue](venue)).

If you have any questions, please see the [FAQ](faq) page or send them directly to Daniel <daniel.himmelstein@gmail.com>.

_See you off the grid and on the river._
