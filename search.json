But you can help us commemmorate the occasion\nby wearing creative and colorful attire for the Saturday ceremony and\nreception. Dress wild! The more extravagant and ugly the better.\nOh behave!The event will be on grass. Do not wear stiletto\nheels. Prefer high-performing footwear or bring a change of\nshoes, such that your celebrate to your fullest ability. See Camping for helpful attire for the whole\nweekend.\nRunning Course\nThe Off the Grid 5k will be Sunday at 9 AM. The race starts and ends\nat the stone flower. It goes around the Path of Life Garden and adjacent\nfarm in a clockwise direction. Run two laps.\nStarting at the Stone Flower, run clockwise on the perimeter gravel\nroad that goes around the deluxe tents. Continue past the reception\ntent. Do not cross the railroad tracks. Never during the race will you\ncross the railroad.\nNext you’ll turn onto a path in the woods and cross a stream that\ndivides the Path of Life Garden and the neighboring farm. Take a left\nout of the woods to continue around the perimeter of the farm, going\naround the solar farm.\nContinue around the entire farm, staying to the left, except not\ncrossing the railroad. When exiting the garm, The path onto the lower\nbridge to return from to Path of Life garden is narrow. The bridge is\nslanted and slippery. Use caution.\nContinue along the grass road in the Path of Life garden. If it’s\nyour second lap, stop at the finish line.\nOff the Grid 5K running course\nsuperimposed on aerial imageryFinal notes\nWe can’t wait to see you in just a couple days at the Loveroo Club\nwedding. It has been an exciting time in the Upper Valley region, with a\nmajor storm causing erosion and downed trees. The dam upstream of the\nPath of Life Garden hit\noutflows of 19,000 cubic feet per second, compared to a historical\nmedian of 3,000 on this day. The moon is poised to go full buck on\nFriday night to ring in the festivities. And Amtrak resumed passenger\nservice on its historic Vermonter line, so attendees can expect twice\ndaily train sightings.\nThe ceremony starts at 4:00 pm Saturday sharp. Please arrive by 3:30\npm.\nThe river trip on Friday departs at 2:00 pm. Arrive by 1:30 pm.\nThe weather looks great with highs of 80°F and lows of 55°F, with a\nslight chance of rain. Nighttime temperatures can be a bit chilly, so\nbring an outer layer and insulation for sleeping.\nIf you’re arriving early Friday for the river trip and need to\nrefrigerate something for the potluck, Artisan Eats is lending us some\nrefrigerator space. When you enter the Path of Life Garden via Great\nRiver Outfitters, ask for the Artisan Eats fridge, which is in the same\nbuilding.\nWe also have coolers at the event tent, and near the deluxe tents.\nBest to bring any booze to these coolers rather than Artisans Eat.\nWe’ll probably have a propane grill going at some points over the\nweekend at one of the deluxe tents.\nIf you’re coming by way of the Dartmouth Coach or Amtrak and need a\nride, let us know. We’ll try to recruit some volunteers to pick you up.\nIn this neck of the woods, hitchhiking is more reliable than Uber or\nLyft.\nLet us know if you’d like to give a short speech at the\nreception.\nWhere do I shower?\nThere are two shower stalls, which operate using solar bags provided\nby the Outfitters. There is also a cold water shower at the shop. The\nConnecticut River is also quite clean and refreshing at this latitude.\nPlease note that the facilities are minimal in general.\nHow can I help?\nWe’d love your help in making our wedding special. Here are some\nexamples of ways you could assist, inspired by actual invitees!\nCan lend my strength for setup\nCan help clean up\nI’m a licensed airman and can take a drone video\nCan play cello\nCan bring a lawn game called King Kubb\nHave AV skills\nHave a 10kW generator you could borrow (Let us know if you have\nthis!)\nCan make wildflower bouquets\nCan do Trang’s hair\nCan be in charge of coffee\nIf you’d like to offer a skill or lend an item, let us know in your\nRSVP or by email. See also the volunteer\nspreadsheet, where you can add yourself with “Suggest Changes”\nmode.\nCan I bring a +1?\nIf we were aware of a likely +1, we probably named them in your\ninvite or sent them a separate invite. If we didn’t, you can still list\nthem as part of your party in the RSVP form or ask us separately. And we\nwill confirm that the additional guest doesn’t exceed capacity\nrestrictions.\nWho helped build the website?\nHuge thanks to our dear friend, Silvia Canelón, for creating this\nbeautiful website.
