With cots and blankets, each deluxe tent can fit at least 6 persons. If your party size is 4-6 or you have other individuals you’d like to stay with, let us know.\n\nFamilies might be a good fit.\nIf you have camping gear (tent, pad, quilt / blanket), please bring it. Otherwise, let us know when RSVPing and we’ll place you in one of the deluxe tents. We will also be setting up extra tents from our surplus gear.\nFor guests that aren’t staying on the premises, we will try to suggest some local hotels, but we will not be heavily involved in this area of the planning.\nCamping map and regulations at https://greatriveroutfitters.com/images/files/Camping_Rules_Regulations.pdf \n\n\n\n",
