_Attendees seeking for the full experience will join us to camp in the garden._

We have reserved a section of the garden for wedding guests to camp, which has 4 preexisting deluxe tents.
With cots and blankets, each deluxe tent can fit at least 6 persons.
If your party size is 4-6 or you have other individuals you'd like to stay with, let us know.

<aside>
Families might be a good fit.

If you have camping gear (tent, pad, quilt / blanket), please bring it.
Otherwise, let us know when RSVPing and we'll place you in one of the deluxe tents.
We will also be setting up extra tents from our surplus gear.

For guests that aren't staying on the premises, we will try to suggest some local hotels, but we will not be heavily involved in this area of the planning.
